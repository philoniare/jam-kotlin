# Project Roadmap

## Vision

Build a production-grade JAM implementation in Scala 3 that provides:
- Complete protocol conformance with the Gray Paper specification
- Reduced code complexity through functional programming
- Type-safe API leveraging Scala's advanced type system
- Full compatibility with official JAM test vectors
- Integration with the JVM ecosystem

### Milestones

#### ✅ M1: IMPORTER (Completed)

State-transitioning conformance tests pass and can import blocks.

**Status:** **COMPLETED** ✅

#### 🚧 M2: AUTHORER (In Progress)

Fully conformant and can produce blocks (including networking and off-chain components).

**Status:** In Progress - completing network implementation

#### 📋 M3: HALF-SPEED (Planned)

Conformance and 50% of required performance.

#### 📋 M4: FULL-SPEED (Planned)

Conformance and 100% of required performance.

#### 📋 M5: SECURE (Planned)

Fully audited implementation.
